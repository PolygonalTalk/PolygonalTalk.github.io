This is the Bizarro-Destiny of games, where it is ALL story and no gameplay. And it works. REALLY well.</p>\n<p>I'll try not to repeat myself from above, but just know that none of that stuff changed. Slightly creepy, immensely lonely, R2 to run... all that is still in the latter half of the game.</p>\n<p><strong>Graphics.</strong><br>This game is gorgeous. From the very first scene where you are looking out over a valley at a sunrise, to the final moments (I won't spoil that scene) I was thoroughly impressed with what the CryEngine 3 can do. From the time shifts, to the weather changes to the sparks falling from the light balls that zip around the town, I was in awe at everything.

This is the Bizarro-Destiny of games, where it is ALL story and no gameplay. And it works. REALLY well.\n\nI'll try not to repeat myself from above, but just know that none of that stuff changed. Slightly creepy, immensely lonely, R2 to run... all that is still in the latter half of the game.\n\n**Graphics.**\nThis game is gorgeous. From the very first scene where you are looking out over a valley at a sunrise, to the final moments (I won't spoil that scene) I was thoroughly impressed with what the CryEngine 3 can do. From the time shifts, to the weather changes to the sparks falling from the light balls that zip around the town, I was in awe at everything. And you get to really take it all in due to the slow pace you'll be walking at. I really should have hitten the \"Share\" button once or twice, but I was so into everything going on around me that it never popped into my head to do so. I will definitely take advantage of that during my next Trophy hunting playthroughs. My only complaint is the framerate. It really, REALLY struggles at times, especially noticeable in the shadows. I'm hoping they fix this via patch as it was jarring enough to take me out of the moment several times.

It is subtle at times and others it sent chills down my spine at just the right moment. Certain actions trigger more intense music and when nothing is going on, sometimes the background sound effects fill the atmosphere with a sense of life, yet utter loneliness. I'm talking gibberish. [Here is a great article that explains it way better than I can.][2] \n\n**Gameplay:**\nWell... hmm... this is an interactive story—with much less emphasis on \"interactive\" than on \"story.\" There isn't much here. You wander around, with the light trails gently nudging you in the correct directions, you press X a few times and tip your controller in one direction or another at certain points.

      "cooked": "<p><em>Full Review:</em></p>\n\n<p>I've never played a \"walking simulator\" before this, but I'm glad I did. This is the Bizarro-Destiny of games, where it is ALL story and no gameplay. And it works. REALLY well.</p>\n\n<p>I'll try not to repeat myself from above, but just know that none of that stuff changed. Slightly creepy, immensely lonely, R2 to run... all that is still in the latter half of the game.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Graphics.</strong><br>This game is gorgeous. From the very first scene where you are looking out over a valley at a sunrise, to the final moments (I won't spoil that scene) I was thoroughly impressed with what the CryEngine 3 can do. From the time shifts, to the weather changes to the sparks falling from the light balls that zip around the town, I was in awe at everything. And you get to really take it all in due to the slow pace you'll be walking at. I really should have hitten the \"Share\" button once or twice, but I was so into everything going on around me that it never popped into my head to do so. I will definitely take advantage of that during my next Trophy hunting playthroughs. My only complaint is the framerate. It really, REALLY struggles at times, especially noticeable in the shadows. I'm hoping they fix this via patch as it was jarring enough to take me out of the moment several times. <a href=\"http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2015-vs-everybodys-gone-to-the-rapture\">You can read more about that here.</a></p>\n\n<a href=\"http://images.eurogamer.net/2013/articles/1/7/7/4/0/1/3/everybodys-gone-to-the-rapture-review-143928049295.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://images.eurogamer.net/2013/articles/1/7/7/4/0/1/3/everybodys-gone-to-the-rapture-review-143928049295.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\"></a>\n\n<p><strong>Sound:</strong><br>The music. Wow. It is subtle at times and others it sent chills down my spine at just the right moment. Certain actions trigger more intense music and when nothing is going on, sometimes the background sound effects fill the atmosphere with a sense of life, yet utter loneliness. I'm talking gibberish. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/30/everybodys-gone-to-the-rapture-video-game-sound-music\">Here is a great article that explains it way better than I can.</a> </p>\n\n<p><strong>Gameplay:</strong><br>Well... hmm... this is an interactive story—with much less emphasis on \"interactive\" than on \"story.\" There isn't much here. You wander around, with the light trails gently nudging you in the correct directions, you press X a few times and tip your controller in one direction or another at certain points. And, yet... it was fun. </p>\n\n<p>This game DOES NOT hand-hold. If you are looking for a Batman Arkham Knight game that puts a dot on a map with a trail of arrows pointing you in the right direction and constant button prompts, this is not that game. I didn't even figure out that I could hop certain fences until later in the game. This made me miss out on some story elements. But then again, I don't think you're supposed to catch everything the first time.

      "raw": "*Full Review:*\n\nI've never played a \"walking simulator\" before this, but I'm glad I did. This is the Bizarro-Destiny of games, where it is ALL story and no gameplay. And it works. REALLY well.\n\nI'll try not to repeat myself from above, but just know that none of that stuff changed. Slightly creepy, immensely lonely, R2 to run... all that is still in the latter half of the game.\n\n**Graphics.**\nThis game is gorgeous. From the very first scene where you are looking out over a valley at a sunrise, to the final moments (I won't spoil that scene) I was thoroughly impressed with what the CryEngine 3 can do. From the time shifts, to the weather changes to the sparks falling from the light balls that zip around the town, I was in awe at everything. And you get to really take it all in due to the slow pace you'll be walking at. I really should have hitten the \"Share\" button once or twice, but I was so into everything going on around me that it never popped into my head to do so. I will definitely take advantage of that during my next Trophy hunting playthroughs. My only complaint is the framerate. It really, REALLY struggles at times, especially noticeable in the shadows. I'm hoping they fix this via patch as it was jarring enough to take me out of the moment several times. [You can read more about that here.][1]\n\nhttp://images.eurogamer.net/2013/articles/1/7/7/4/0/1/3/everybodys-gone-to-the-rapture-review-143928049295.jpg\n\n**Sound:**\nThe music. Wow. It is subtle at times and others it sent chills down my spine at just the right moment. Certain actions trigger more intense music and when nothing is going on, sometimes the background sound effects fill the atmosphere with a sense of life, yet utter loneliness. I'm talking gibberish. [Here is a great article that explains it way better than I can.][2] \n\n**Gameplay:**\nWell... hmm... this is an interactive story—with much less emphasis on \"interactive\" than on \"story.\" There isn't much here. You wander around, with the light trails gently nudging you in the correct directions, you press X a few times and tip your controller in one direction or another at certain points. And, yet... it was fun. \n\nThis game DOES NOT hand-hold. If you are looking for a Batman Arkham Knight game that puts a dot on a map with a trail of arrows pointing you in the right direction and constant button prompts, this is not that game. I didn't even figure out that I could hop certain fences until later in the game. This made me miss out on some story elements. But then again, I don't think you're supposed to catch everything the first time. And you get so used to NOT interacting with things, that you miss some Trophy opportunities.\n\nhttp://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434715708491/7e7cbf63-e4c4-409d-8d4b-cfd1205319ab-620x372.jpeg?w=620&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=1aebff12c03382ac460344505d6e698e\n\n**Story:**\nWhat can I say? The whole game is story and it's a good one. You \"meet\" various characters, and you follow them through the events that led to their disappearance. You get to see their personalities, good or bad, their struggles, their fears at what was going on... and in some cases, these stories nearly made my eyes water. Ok, maybe a little bit.
