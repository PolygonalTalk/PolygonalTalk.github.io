Have you guys heard of this service?  It's essentially an alternative to Kickstarter that they are positioning to be much more about investing in a game then simply backing it.  You can read more about it here:

[Polygon Fig Article](http://www.polygon.com/2015/8/18/9169697/fig-kickstarter-equity-investment-games-outer-wilds-masi-oka)

But here are the highlights:

> Near the bottom of the page, Bailey says that traditional crowdfunding reward tiers will be available, including t-shirts and the like as well as digital and/or physical copies of games once completed. But in addition to these rewards-based options, **accredited investors will also be able to dig a little deeper into the site and purchase actual equity in game.**

> In the coming months, Bailey says, anyone with cash on hand will be able to get a piece of the action — no accreditation required. Their reward? **A cut of the game's earnings upon release**.

> "You get a percentage of the revenue share," Bailey said. "That’s going to be called out pretty concisely on the page. The terms are static. We have lead investors that are involved. ... They work out the deal terms that they’re investing in, and the people investing alongside them get to do it on the same terms.

Listening to the Beastcast, it gets much more complicated than that, where they essentially setup a holding company that funds just this particular game, but most of what they talk about is over my head.

Enough with the business end, how are the games?  Apparently they will only be listing a handful a month, I'm guessing because of the level of complexity involved, but here is the first:

Ahh yeah, that's Hiro.  I'm assuming that means an instant backing by @DarthSmurfX
