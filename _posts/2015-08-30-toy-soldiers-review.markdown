The premise is pretty cool. Imagine you are a kid and you are playing with your toys in a cross pollination kind of way. Army men are playing with pixies, Sci-Fi soldiers are fighting Knights or Ninjas. Now combine that with part RTS, part Tower Defense, and part 3rd Person Shooter and you get Toy Soldiers: War Chest.

**PROS:**

Great premise

The use of He-Man, GI Joe, and Cobra

CO-OP or Versus both online or off

Ability to customize your armies any way you want in terms of equipment and other items like armor and firing range.

Pretty high replay value

**CONS:**

The learning curve can be steep if you've never played any of the other Toy Soldier titles. I highly suggest doing the tutorial.

The load times. Jaysus fucking Christ. It's 2015 and I'm on a next gen console. There is no excuse for this.

Graphics are just ok. Not a deal breaker and not needed for this kind of game. But they are just ok. Plus the frame rate can lag at times.

Assassin's Creed tie in is weird. The theme goes with the game but it's not really a toy and it doesn't have a nostalgic feel to it the way the other toys do.

Use of U-Play. I hate that some of the items you can equip or use with your armies are locked behind the amount of "tokens" you have earned on U-Play.

**Overall:**

The game really is a lot of fun once you dive into it and get the hang of it. It's also quite challenging when playing the "campaign". Plus the price points for the game are great. I went with the Hall of Fame Edition for $30. If you are on the fence I think the standard version for $15 is a good buy and you can always upgrade to the HoF version for $15 via download.

I'd give it a very solid **7.5/10**. If they could patch the frame rate issues and improve the load times I'd bump it up to a 8 or 8.5.

I'll capture some gameplay video and post it later.
